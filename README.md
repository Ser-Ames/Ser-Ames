I'm Amie, a self taught js dev

I currently am in university doing a Bachelor of Computing Systems and I really enjoy it.

I spend most of my time either playing Rainbow Six: Siege or programming.

Most of my projects are for fun and never something that I get paid for (although getting paid would just be a nice little bonus)

When I finish my bachelors degree I want to work as a server administrator or web developer using my creative problem solving skills to come up with solutions in code.
